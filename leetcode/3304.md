### Question 3304: Find the K-th Character in String Game I

-   **Difficulty**: `Easy`
-   **Tags**: [Arrays, Bit Manipulation, Recursion, Simulation]
-   **Link**: [LeetCode Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-i/description)

---

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string `word = "a"`.

You are given a positive integer `k`.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation **forever**:

-   Generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word.

**For example**, performing the operation on `"c"` generates `"cd"` and performing the operation on `"zb"` generates `"zbac"`.

Return the value of the kth character in word, after enough operations have been done for word to have at least `k` characters.

**Note:** that the character `'z'` can be changed to `'a'` in the operation.

**Constraints:**

1. `1 <= k <= 500`

<h1 align="center">EXAMPLES</h1>

#### **Example 1**

```
Input: k = 5
Output: "b"
Explanation: Initially, word = "a". We need to do the operation three times:
Generated string is "b", word becomes "ab".
Generated string is "bc", word becomes "abbc".
Generated string is "bccd", word becomes "abbcbccd".
```

#### **Example 2**

```
Input: k = 10
Output: "c"
```

<h1 align="center">SOLUTION</h1>

```cpp
// 3304 (Find the K-th Character in String Game I)

char kthCharacter(int k) {
    string word = "a";

    while (word.size() < k) {
        string temp = word;

        for (int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++)
            word[i] = char(int(word[i]) + 1);

        word = temp + word;
    }

    return word[k - 1];
}
```
