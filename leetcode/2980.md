### Question 2980: Check if Bitwise OR Has Trailing Zeros

---

You are given an array of positive integers nums.

You have to check if it is possible to select **two or more** elements in the array such that the `bitwise OR` of the selected elements has at least one trailing zero in its binary representation.

For example, the binary representation of `5`, which is `"101"`, does not have any trailing zeros, whereas the binary representation of `4`, which is `"100"`, has two trailing zeros.

Return `true` if it is possible to select two or more elements whose `bitwise OR` has trailing zeros, return `false` otherwise.

**Constraints:**

1. `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
2. `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

<h1 align="center">EXAMPLES</h1>

#### **Example 1**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: If we select the elements 2 and 4, their bitwise OR is 6, which has the binary representation "110" with one trailing zero.
```

#### **Example 2**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,8,16]
Output: true
Explanation: If we select the elements 2 and 4, their bitwise OR is 6, which has the binary representation "110" with one trailing zero.
Other possible ways to select elements to have trailing zeroes in the binary representation of their bitwise OR are: (2, 8), (2, 16), (4, 8), (4, 16), (8, 16), (2, 4, 8), (2, 4, 16), (2, 8, 16), (4, 8, 16), and (2, 4, 8, 16).
```

<h1 align="center">SOLUTION</h1>

```cpp
// 2980 (Check if Bitwise OR Has Trailing Zeros)

bool hasTrailingZeros(vector<int>& nums) {
    bool anyNo = false;

    for (int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++)
        if ((nums[i] & 1) == 0) {
            if (anyNo) return true;
            else anyNo = true;
        }

    return false;
}
```
