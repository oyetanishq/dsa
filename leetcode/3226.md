### Question 3226: Number of Bit Changes to Make Two Integers Equal

-   **Difficulty**: `Easy`
-   **Tags**: [Bit Manipulation]
-   **Link**: [LeetCode Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-bit-changes-to-make-two-integers-equal/description)

---

You are given two positive integers `n` and `k`.

You can choose any bit in the binary representation of `n` that is equal to 1 and change it to 0.

Return the number of changes needed to make `n` equal to `k`. If it is impossible, return -1.

**Constraints:**

1. `1 <= n, k <= 1e6`

<h1 align="center">EXAMPLES</h1>

#### **Example 1**

```
Input: n = 13, k = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Initially, the binary representations of n and k are n = (1101)2 and k = (0100)2.
We can change the first and fourth bits of n. The resulting integer is n = (0100)2 = k.
```

#### **Example 2**

```
Input: n = 21, k = 21
Output: 0
Explanation: n and k are already equal, so no changes are needed.
```

<h1 align="center">SOLUTION</h1>

```cpp
// 3226 (Number of Bit Changes to Make Two Integers Equal)

int minChanges(int n, int k) {
    int ans = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        int n_ith_bit = (n & (1 << i));
        int k_ith_bit = (k & (1 << i));

        if ((n_ith_bit ^ k_ith_bit)) {
            if (n_ith_bit) ans++;
            else return -1;
        }

    }

    return ans;
}
```
