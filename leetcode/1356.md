### Question 1356: Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits

-   **Difficulty**: `Easy`
-   **Tags**: [Arrays, Bit Manipulation, Sorting, Counting]
-   **Link**: [LeetCode Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-integers-by-the-number-of-1-bits/description)

---

You are given an integer array `arr`. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number of `1's` in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of `1's` you have to sort them in ascending order.

Return the array after sorting it.

**Constraints:**

1. `1 <= arr.length <= 500`
2. `0 <= arr[i] <= 1e4`

<h1 align="center">EXAMPLES</h1>

#### **Example 1**

```
Input: arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
Explantion: [0] is the only integer with 0 bits.
[1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.
[3,5,6] have 2 bits.
[7] has 3 bits.
The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
```

#### **Example 2**

```
Input: arr = [1024,512,256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]
Output: [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024]
Explantion: All integers have 1 bit in the binary representation, you should just sort them in ascending order.
```

<h1 align="center">SOLUTION</h1>

```cpp
// 1356 (Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits)

static bool compare(int a, int b) {
    int countA = __builtin_popcount(a);
    int countB = __builtin_popcount(b);

    if (countA == countB) return a < b;
    else return countA < countB;
}

vector<int> sortByBits(vector<int>& arr) {
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end(), compare);
    return arr;
}
```
