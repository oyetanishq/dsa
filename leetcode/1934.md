### Question 1934: Confirmation Rate  

- **Difficulty**: `Medium`  
- **Tags**: [Database]  
- **Link**: [LeetCode Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/confirmation-rate/description)

**Table:** `Signups`
|Column Name|Type|
|-|-|
|user_id|int|
|time_stamp|datetime|
Note: user_id is primary key.

**Table:** `Confirmations`
|Column Name|Type|
|-|-|
|user_id|int|
|time_stamp|datetime|
|action|enum('confirmed, 'timeout')|
Note: (user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key.

The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is 0. Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.

Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.

Return the result table in any order

### Solution  

```sql
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    ROUND(AVG(IF(c.action = 'confirmed', 1, 0)), 2) AS confirmation_rate

FROM (Signups AS s) LEFT JOIN (Confirmations AS c)
ON (s.user_id = c.user_id)

GROUP BY user_id;
```
