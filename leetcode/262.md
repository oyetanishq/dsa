### Question 262: Trips and Users  

- **Difficulty**: `Hard`  
- **Tags**: [Database]  
- **Link**: [LeetCode Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/trips-and-users/description/)

---

**Table:** `Trips`
|Column Name|Type|
|-|-|
| id          | int      |
| client_id   | int      |
| driver_id   | int      |
| city_id     | int      |
| status      | enum('completed', 'cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client')     |
| request_at  | varchar  |

Note: `id` is the primary key. The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique id, while client_id and `driver_id` are foreign keys to the `users_id` at the Users table.

**Table:** `Users`
|Column Name|Type|
|-|-|
|user_id|int|
|banned|enum('Yes', 'No')|
|role|enum('client', 'driver', 'partner')|

Note: `users_id` is the primary key. The table holds all users. Each user has a unique `users_id`, `role`, and `banned` status.

The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Write a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between `2013-10-01` and `2013-10-03`. Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.

Return the result table in any order.

```sql
--- 262 (Trips and Users)

SELECT
    Trips.request_at AS 'Day',
    ROUND(AVG(IF(Trips.status != 'completed', 1, 0)), 2) AS 'Cancellation Rate'

FROM
    Trips JOIN (Users AS clients)
    ON(
        (Trips.client_id = clients.users_id) AND
        (clients.role = 'client') AND
        (clients.banned = 'No')
    )

    JOIN (Users AS drivers)
    ON(
        (Trips.driver_id = drivers.users_id) AND
        (drivers.role = 'driver') AND
        (drivers.banned = 'No')
    )

WHERE (Trips.request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03')
GROUP BY Trips.request_at;
