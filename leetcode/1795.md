### Question 1795: Rearrange Products Table  

- **Difficulty**: `Easy`  
- **Tags**: [Database]
- **Link**: [LeetCode Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-products-table/description)

---

**Table:** `Products`
|Column Name|Type|
|-|-|
| product_id  | int     |
| store1      | int     |
| store2      | int     |
| store3      | int     |

**Note**: `product_id` is the primary key. Each row in this table indicates the product's price in 3 different stores: store1, store2, and store3. If the product is not available in a store, the price will be null in that store's column.

Write a solution to rearrange the Products table so that each row has (product_id, store, price). If a product is not available in a store, do not include a row with that product_id and store combination in the result table.

Return the result table in any order.

**Table:** `Products`

| product_id | store1 | store2 | store3 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0          | 95     | 100    | 105    |
| 1          | 70     | null   | 80     |

**Table:** `Output`

| product_id | store  | price |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 0          | store1 | 95    |
| 0          | store2 | 100   |
| 0          | store3 | 105   |
| 1          | store1 | 70    |
| 1          | store3 | 80    |
