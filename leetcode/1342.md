---

Given an integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.

In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

#### **Example 1**

```
Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation:
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3.
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2.
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
```

#### **Example 2**

```
Input: num = 8
Output: 4
Explanation:
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4.
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2.
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
```

<h1 align="center">SOLUTION</h1>

```cpp
// 1342 (Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero)

int numberOfSteps(int num) {
    int steps = 0;

    while (num) {
        if (num & 1) num--; // num is odd
        else num = (num >> 1); // num is even

        steps++;
    }

    return steps;
}
```
