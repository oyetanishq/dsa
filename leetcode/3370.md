### Question 3370: Smallest Number With All Set Bits

-   **Difficulty**: `Easy`
-   **Tags**: [Math, Bit Manipulation]
-   **Link**: [LeetCode Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-number-with-all-set-bits/description)

---

You are given a positive number `n`.

Return the smallest number `x` greater than or equal to `n`, such that the binary representation of `x` contains only set bits.

A set bit refers to a bit in the binary representation of a number that has a value of `1`.

**Constraints:**

1. `1 <= n <= 1000`


<h1 align="center">EXAMPLES</h1>

#### **Example 1**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: The binary representation of 7 is "111".
```

#### **Example 2**

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 15
Explanation: The binary representation of 15 is "1111".
```

<h1 align="center">SOLUTION</h1>

```cpp
// 3370 (Smallest Number With All Set Bits)

int smallestNumber(int n) {
    int ans = 1;

    while (true) {
        if (ans >= n) return ans;
        ans = (ans << 1) | (1);
    }
}
```
