    Students.student_name,
    Subjects.subject_name,
    SUM(IF(Examinations.student_id, 1, 0)) AS 'attended_exams'

FROM
    (Students JOIN Subjects)

    LEFT JOIN Examinations
    ON(
        (Students.student_id = Examinations.student_id) AND
        (Subjects.subject_name = Examinations.subject_name)
    )

GROUP BY Students.student_id, Subjects.subject_name
ORDER BY Students.student_id, Subjects.subject_name;
