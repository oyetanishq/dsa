### Question 1174: Immediate Food Delivery II  

- **Difficulty**: `Medium`  
- **Tags**: [Database]
- **Link**: [LeetCode Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/immediate-food-delivery-ii/description)

---

**Table:** `Delivery`
|Column Name|Type|
|-|-|
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |

**Note**: `delivery_id` is the primary key. The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

SELECT ROUND(AVG(ordeR_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100, 2) AS immediate_percentage

FROM Delivery
WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN (SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) FROM Delivery GROUP BY customer_id);
